Ms. Cianci helped me figure out the refresh button. I could use the word "this" to pass the frame itself! Problem solved!

I started putting confirmation messages around my application for when people save, delete, edit, and exit a page without saving. The problem right now is that it goes ahead with the action even if the user clicked 'No'.

Woops, I had a semicolon at the end of my if statement....

Time to comment, away!!

Actually, no, gonna work on that tomorrow. Have another summative to do.
