I worked mainly on the JournalEntry class today. I created more or less everything I'll need to use from now on.

A new method came to me today that i didn't think of before. I made it so that setTitle would not only change the title for the object, but change the file name as well. This is in anticipation of something I hadn't thought of before: editing entries.

The rest of the day was spent on making the JTable in my MainFrame display information based on the files in a folder with the name of the journal.

I didn't work on it nearly as much as I had wanted too, mainly because I had an essay to write for another summative.
